Hello, my name is **Thibault Laurens**,I am a 22 years old french student living in Oxford, United Kingdom!

Like the logo in the footer, yes I am **nuts about tech**! I discovered programing almost 4 years ago and since this day I just can't stop.
I started with C# and the .NET framework (with which I worked and still today work a lot) and then I discovered many other interesting languages and frameworks like Ruby, C++, Python and even JavaScript! ( thanks to Node.js :) )
I like to learn new things every day (which includes playing around with some cool tools!), to use the right technology for the right job and to find simple solutions to real life problems.

What am I doing in the **UK**?

I landed here in October 2011 in order to continue my studies for
<a href="http://www.supinfo.com/en/Default.aspx" title="supinfo.com" target="_blank"><strong>SUPINFO International University</strong></a> 
, but also to improve my English and to discover a new culture.
I spend an amazing year in London and I move in September 2012 to Oxford.
I currently study a master's degree in Computer Science at
<a href="http://www.brookes.ac.uk/" title="brookes.ac.uk" target="_blank"><strong>Oxford Brookes University</strong></a> 
and I really enjoy it!

I am also a budding photographer (just

 who loves to travel, meet new people and explore the world.

Feel free to contact me!
